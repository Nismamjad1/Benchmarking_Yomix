# Code to reproduce Yomix paper figures

### Run main.py on the file of your choice to run cosg, yomix's function to compute signature and scanpy(t-test, wilcoxon)

In a python virtual environment, do:

    python3 main.py [path_to_your_file]

where your file is an anndata object (h5ad format) with 'labels' in obs field

The results will be stored in the 'result' folder as csv files : one for the perfomances of the classifiers on the signatures from the different methods, the other with the time it took to compute those methods (with the suffix _runtime)

Now you can run the scripts to plot the figures by passing the file recently produced as argument

To get the performances comparison across labels:

	python3 figures_std [filepath]

To get run time comparison:

	python3 time_result.py [filepath]
